# Network Management System

## Overview
An advanced network administration system designed for proactive monitoring and intelligent assessment of network infrastructure. The system provides real-time monitoring of routers, switches, and firewalls, with sophisticated incident response capabilities and predictive analytics.

### Key Features
- **Intelligent Monitoring**: Real-time surveillance of network devices and infrastructure
- **ML-Powered Anomaly Detection**: Predictive analysis of potential failures and network anomalies
- **Smart Alert System**: Priority-based incident categorization with automated notifications
- **Advanced Visualization**: Comprehensive dashboards for network metrics and performance
- **Automated Response**: Streamlined incident management and response workflows

### Technology Stack
- **Containerization**: Docker and Kubernetes
- **Monitoring Stack**: ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
- **Network Tools**: SNMP, Nmap
- **Machine Learning**: Predictive maintenance models
- **Notification System**: Automated email alerts

## Prerequisites
- Kubernetes cluster (v1.19+)
- Docker (20.10+)
- Sufficient cluster resources for ELK stack deployment
- Network access to monitored devices
- SMTP server for email notifications
